                    He was here last year for the winterfest dance. All of the students loved
                    his music and entertainment so much that we asked the school to bring him
                    back this year. He is really cool and he brings good fun energy too while
                    he is playing all the music we love to listen to.

                    honestly say that every detail we discussed was executed flawlessly. 
                    We all had so much FUN on the dance floor, we didn't want it to end. 
                    Thank you Sqratchclick!

                    <p class="review-text">From the start Todd made sure we discussed our 
                    vision, style and preferences and a song list that we wanted before 
                    the event. He played the songs in a great order and was able to read 
                    the room to add even more great hits. Our coworkers were dancing from 
                    the second he cranked up the tunes to the very last song. I would 1000% 
                    recommend Sqratchclick for any event that you have that needs music. 
                    This is what a professional DJ provides!
